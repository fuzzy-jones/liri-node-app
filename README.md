# liri-node-app

* In this assignment I created a LIRI (Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface) node app, which takes in command line parameters and returns data. This app uses npm packages to make requests to Twitter, Spotify, and OMBD.

### Instructions

* There are 4 different command line args that can be passed as the 3rd arg, and will return data based on the request made. The 4 possible args are as follows.   
    * `my-tweets`
    * `spotify-this-song`
    * `movie-this`
    * `do-what-it-says`
* Example command.. 'node liri.js my-tweets', will make a twitter request and return data.

### What each command does

* node liri.js my-tweets
    * Will console log tweets from a twitter account set up to demo this app.

* node liri.js spotify-this-song [any song name here]
    * Will console log the follow data from Spotify for the specified song.
        * Artist(s)

        * A preview link of the song from Spotify

    * Will console log the following data from OMDB for the specified movie.
